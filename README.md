# Hi there, I'm Dang Van Minh! 👋

### 🚀 AI Research Engineer | Spatial Intelligence & Multimodal VLMs

I am a researcher and engineer dedicated to **bridging the gap between academic theory and industrial reality**. My focus is on **Spatial Reasoning**—teaching AI not just to "see" (semantics) but to "perceive" (geometry/depth) in complex 3D environments like warehouses and autonomous systems.

Currently, I am a Master's Candidate at **[HCMUT](https://hcmut.edu.vn/)**, optimizing Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for high-precision tasks on edge and real world problems.

### 🔭 My Mission: From Research to Real-World Value
I don't just train models; I build **scalable data engines** and **efficient architectures** that work outside the lab.
* **Problem:** Standard VLMs struggle with fine-grained spatial tasks (counting, distance, alignment).
* **My Solution:** Engineering novel **Region Feature Enhancers** that fuse RGB and Depth data explicitly, validated on NVIDIA A100 clusters.
* **The Goal:** Robust, safety-critical AI for industrial automation.
